Nice, now that you've found Daniel Kane, I need an example from one of his classes. I don't remember anything about it other than its called "The Skyline Problem". Can you find it?

Firstly, I had searched for "daniel kane" on google and it showed the prof's homepage as the first link. Took a look at it, but couldn't get anything.
Next, tried searching for "daniel kane skyline problem", and a youtube video showed up. It was one of the classes taken by the prof. Noticed that the video had only one comment, which says " I understood the first two minutes lol. ". 


This looked like a hint, so i ended up watching the first 2 mins of the video, but nothing there too XD. I looked on the profile of the person who had commented and found this


This looked like a date and timing of a video.
Searched for videos on this day and still no luck
This was like a dead end !
I read the description again and noticed "an example from one of his classes", so i started searching for the prof's classes online. 
no luck, just some coursera links.

This was when i went back to the prof's homepage and found links to his classes there.
Tried manually searching a little and it sure would be a tedious task to continue like this.
So i tried google dorking and found something like this:


Found a pdf file with "the skyline problem" in it.
This might be it. Opened the pdf file and found the flag at the bottom of the page.
