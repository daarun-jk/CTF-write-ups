Location 1 :
"?v=<parameter>" is something we are familiar with, youtube.
Hence, on going to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqXOIZtRYZU , we get the 1st half of the flag in the video (a person reads it out ):
sdctf{W0w_1

Location2 :

This is an image file
As compared to the previous one (popular video sharing platform), this might be a popular platform for sharing images.
a simple google search for it said that imgur is one of the most popular image hosting platform.
